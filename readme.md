###### About the Project

This project is an Audio Plugin Synth made with the JUCE Framework. The synth is a drone comprised of many Sine Oscillators that
randomise their frequency, level, and pan positioning according to parameters set by the user in the GUI.

###### Forking this Project

To get the code working on your local machine, simply fork and clone it as you normally would. The project is built with JUCE's Projucer program so in order
to build it you will need to <a href="https://juce.com/get-juce/">download JUCE</a> if you haven't already and open the .jucer file with the Projucer.
Then you will be able to open the project with whichever exporter you have installed (e.g. Visual Studio) and build the project in the format that you wish.
Currently the project is set up for VST3 and standalone .exe formats, but you can add more format options in the Projucer.
